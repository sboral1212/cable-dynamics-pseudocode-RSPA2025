This repository contains *non-executable pseudocode* and high-level algorithmic documentation 
supporting the above manuscript.

⚠ **Important:**  
The full MATLAB implementation used in the study is part of an ongoing, proprietary research 
codebase and is **not** publicly released. The materials here provide *transparent documentation* 
of the numerical workflow and enable independent re-implementation.

Contents:

- `pseudocode.tex` — LaTeX source for the code algorithm and code flowchart  
- `Pseudocode.pdf` — compiled diagram  
- Description of numerical workflow (static solver, dynamic solver, force model)

For academic, non-commercial collaboration requests, the full MATLAB code may be shared in a 
controlled manner.
